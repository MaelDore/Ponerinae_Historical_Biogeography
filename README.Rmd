   A cornerstone of biogeography since its early developments has been to disentangle the drivers of the distribution of biodiversity patterns worldwide. Here we produce a complete species-level phylogeny of the subfamily of ponerine ants (Formicidae: Ponerinae) based on new phylogenomic sequencing and taxonomic grafting. We combine results with a large-scale geographic database to explore the interplay of the main mechanisms shaping global ponerine biodiversity patterns. We show that extant ponerine ants originated in Gondwana, spread primarily eastward across tropical bioregions, and then more recently expanded toward temperate areas. Differences in the timing of colonization events were identified as the prominent key drivers of present-day biodiversity patterns. In addition, differences in diversification rates and asymmetrical dispersal histories acted as buffers of the heterogeneity in biodiversity by fueling accumulation of lineages in the least diverse bioregions. These results suggest that tropical niche conservatism played a major role in shaping the biogeographic and evolutionary history of Ponerinae. They also highlight the importance of considering the timing of past biogeographic and evolutionary events, in complement to the scrutiny of differences in current diversification rates, to gain a deeper understanding of Earth’s biodiversity patterns.

## How to run it

This research has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need
installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from [this URL](https://github.com/MaelDore/Ponerinae_Historical_Biogeography/zipball/master/). After unzipping:
  
  - Open the `Ponerinae_Historical_Biogeography.Rproj` file, found at the root of the project, in RStudio

  - Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file\_folder: **scripts**](scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the outputs, maps, graphs, figures and tables, including the final ones presented in the main text of the article.
