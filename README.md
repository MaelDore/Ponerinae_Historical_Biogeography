A cornerstone of biogeography since its early developments has been to
disentangle the drivers of the distribution of biodiversity patterns
worldwide. Here we leverage a large-scale geographic database and a new
species-level phylogeny to explore the interplay of the main mechanisms
shaping global biodiversity patterns in the subfamily of ponerine ants
(Formicidae: Ponerinae). We show that extant ponerine ants originated in
Gondwana, spread primarily eastward across tropical bioregions, and then
more recently expanded toward temperate areas. Differences in the timing
of colonization events were the main drivers of present-day biodiversity
patterns, while differences in diversification rates and asymmetrical
dispersal histories acted instead as buffers of the heterogeneity in
biodiversity across bioregions. This suggests that tropical niche
conservatism played a major role in shaping the biogeographic and
evolutionary history of Ponerinae. It also highlights the importance of
considering the timing of past biogeographic and evolutionary events, in
complement to the scrutiny of differences in current diversification
rates, to gain a deeper understanding of Earth’s biodiversity patterns.

## How to run it

This research has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To run the analyses, you will need installed on your
computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and
optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the entire project as a `.zip` from [this
URL](https://github.com/MaelDore/Ponerinae_Historical_Biogeography/zipball/master/).
After unzipping:

- Open the `Ponerinae_Historical_Biogeography.Rproj` file, found at the
  root of the project, in RStudio

- Run sequentially the scripts found in the [:file_folder:
  **scripts**](scripts/) folder. It will rebuild the outputs, maps,
  graphs, figures and tables, including the final ones presented in the
  main text of the article.
